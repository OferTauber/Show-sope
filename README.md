# Shop

This is the second project I create using React (the previous one is the dice game) - and what fun it is!
This is a front-end project of a comic shop for particularly bad fictitious products. The back end relies on mockapi, and the style is pure semantic ui.

Feel free to add and edit products - have fun!

# Goals

The project implements CRUD and thus allows reading, adding, editing and deleting items from the API
This is a "single page application" - browsing is done via Route (without using "Switch - the application uses react-router-dom version 5.3.3, which does not support this command)
